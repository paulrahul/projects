<p>The idea behind this app was to help users with generating relevant usernames instead of having to always add random digits to their preferred usernames to finally get one. E.g. say there's a person named "Saurabh Singh", which happens to be a very common Indian name. Now Saurabh Singh usually goes through a hellish experience as he tries to register for a popular website as all usernames with a combination of "Saurabh" and "Singh" are usually taken. He then goes onto add his year of birth, or his date of birth or other such random suffixes or prefixes to hopefully strike a jackpot. Often, this goes on for quite some time till the user settles down for some awkward looking alphanumeric combination, far from what they originally intended. Such usernames lack personal contexts and are often quite ugly or cryptic to remember. And this, just in the year 2021. Spare a thought for the Saurabh Singhs that will be born in 2050.</p>
<p>Our service stores a user's key personal data and preferences, and uses those keywords to suggest more intuitive and readable usernames. We also use the context of the domain to suggest more relevant usernames. E.g. JohnDoeWork will be suggested for a work related domain while the same user might get JohnDoeRocks for a Spotify registration. Our service also goes and checks if the suggested usernames are already registered or not, saving time for the user (this is yet to be developed) A future usecase for this service would be to predictively register usernames. Much like domain names are owned today by domain registrars who predictively register domain names, and then resell them at a much higher price. The same demand might come up in future for usernames when the future Saurabh Singhs won't be satisfied with a "saurabhs239846234" username, but would rather pay a premium to get "designersaurabh" username or "harvestmoonfeels".</p>

<p><strong>Some notes on Privacy</strong></p>
<p>We collect these details to be able to suggest usernames relevant to you and your personality. None of the information asked for here is (or should be) confidential. Do be careful to not provide any keywords or patterns that you tend to use in your passwords. We do not store the usernames that our system suggests to you, and even if we had, that would have been safe as usernames are usually not confidential. Also, yeh aiwai timepass project hai, so zyada sawal na poochiye.</p>
